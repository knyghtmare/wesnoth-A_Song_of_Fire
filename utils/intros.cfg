It is a tale of civilisations, heroes and heroines from a long-gone aeon: it tells of King Abhai III of Garet-Desh, the owner of the fabled Rod of Justice; of the great dragon Shek'har, father of Shek'kahan and Krahkrahs; of High Ascendant Maat, goddess amongst humans; of the Aragwaithi people, once paramount amongst the humans of the Great Continent... And of how the Sky Soul, the fateful gem that caused so many wars and so much strife, was formed."

Daughter of an Aragwaith woman and a man from the eastern steppes, she spent most of her childhood in a small village in the Aragwaith Meadows. Her life there was never happy, for she was often bullied by other villagers due to her mixed heritage and to her mother being single. When the latter died, the young Myra fled the place, venturing into the Southern Wilderness; and there, she would have been killed by wild beasts or nomadic drake bands, hadn't Maat found her."

Before leaving, she asked King Abhai III, her close friend, to send some troops to the Windy Mountains, for she feared some dark deed was on the way. A few weeks passed, but nothing else happened; and in the Valley of Hashira, Myra anxiously waited for her foster mother's return while studying as the pupil of Lashimi, headmistress of the Windsong haven (or school) in the region. And it is there that our tale begins, with the onset of what would be known as the Last War..."

The king's castle was surprisingly simple, with little embellishment, but it looked like a fortress capable of withstanding the heaviest and longest sieges. The dwarf king sat on his throne in a great room, flanked by his many children and the most trusted warriors; Aiglur bowed to him and introduced the Windsong girls. Myra had never met a king before, and so she felt quite awkward, but the kind smile the king gave her made the young woman feel much better."

They soon found Alenya on a bed surrounded by the Windsong that had delivered the child; she was pale, sweaty and utterly exhausted, but it was with bliss on her face that she showed her friends the newborn Belendra, a girl who was as fair as an elf and as healthy as a dwarf."

She had to do that - only she could defeat that evil and make sure there was a better world for Aldrik, Belendra, Jevyan and all others. And, if she had to sacrifice herself to do that, just as her foster-mother had done..."

Leaving Jevyan and the Windsong protecting the valley, she mounted her strongest and swiftest razorbird and flew back to Maat'Kare. Once there, she was surprised to see her father greet her with an extremely worried expression on his face. He told him a warg messenger had arrived that morning and put him on par of the events concerning Hiera'Laksha. When he asked her whether she and Akashia had managed to repel the Celestial army, Myra could no longer hold herself, and she cried on Tarkyn's shoulder, blaming herself for Akashia's downfall, for exposing her to the Soul's corruption, and for failing to understand her true feelings..."

She was fully aware that every minute wasted gave Grigorius more time to do whatever he intended to do, but Myra felt she'd never have another chance to delight her eyes in Aldrik again, and so she allowed herself that indulgence. At sunset, however, she realized that any further delay would be irresponsibility, and so she did that which was certainly the hardest of her acts: to bid her son farewell. At least he, in his innocence, didn't know that her mother would probably not return; the same, however, couldn't be said of Tarkyn..."

Jevyan, the Windsong and Dvalin promptly pledged themselves to follow her; Alenya, who was already recovered, insisted on going as well, claiming she wouldn't bear remaining idle, and that she too wanted to fight for her child's future. She so insisted that the friends yielded; leaving Belendra under the care of those mysterious fairies, Alenya accompanied Myra, Jevyan, Dvalin, the Windsong and the Aigathol dwarves southwards."

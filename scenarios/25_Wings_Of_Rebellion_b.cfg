Since then, we have combated evil and corruption on Irdya as we could, especially after the fall of the Sky Dragon. As Lord Agniballi already watched over the Great Continent and the Vast Sea, we limited our jurisdiction to this continent, helping maintain the balance of power between the many native races, and trying - regretfully with little success - to enlighten them with the message of order and harmony of the Creator."

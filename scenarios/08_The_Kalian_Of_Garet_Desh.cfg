Thus the High Dragon of Water, Nitiballi, was born; he stopped the dragons' rampage and saved the world's fauna and flora. However, he exceeded himself, and threatened to bring an end to the dragons themselves. Not willing to destroy any of Irdya's races, the Ancient Ones chose another dragon, one whose honour and dedication to his own people was remarkable, and made him as strong as Nitiballi, allowing him to retain his original element. Thus Agniballi, the High Dragon of Fire, was born, and he confronted Nitiballi in a battle which, as expected, ended in stalemate."

This third dragon was Svarballi, the High Dragon of the Sky. Afterwards, the Ancient Ones disappeared; some say they had decided to leave the world thriving on its own, and withdrew to wherever they'd come from."

The Sky Dragon fulfilled his duty well, and maintained order in the world. However, he grew increasingly harsher, resorting to whatever measure it took to maintain his notion of order; ultimately, he concluded that life was bound to be self-destructive, and decided that protecting it was no longer worthwhile. Thus he went on a rampage all over Irdya, destroying vast extensions of land and killing thousands."

It was then that both the Water and the Fire Dragons were possessed by a power greater even than Svarballi's, and with that power they finally defeated him. However, for some reason he wasn't killed: instead, his soul was sealed away in a secret place."

In order to heal it and make sure life would continue to exist, Nitiballi unleashed rainfalls and floods, gathered stormclouds and birthed rivers, all with magic waters that gradually healed the world, reviving its soils and vegetation, restoring the environment to its former state. Unfortunately, the effort was too great for Nitiballi, who died shortly later; but his crystallized body kept unleashing an endless stream of life water: thus he became the Fountain of Life. This is the Legend of the High Dragons."

I investigated it, and there I saw a dragon-shaped crystal statue from which a massive water flow sprouted. It still bore vestiges of healing magic, and thus I knew that was the Fountain of Life. I guessed that consuming and bathing in those waters for so long would have some notable effect on Myra, and I was proved right years later, when she showed her affinity with nature's spirits by summoning her first elemental."

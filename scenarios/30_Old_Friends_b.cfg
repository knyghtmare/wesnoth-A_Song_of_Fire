Besides, I doubt the Seraphins would ever guess that I left the gem with you; either they'd think I'd never relinquish its ownership out of greediness, or that I'd never trust it to someone less powerful than myself. Besides, with the cloaking ciphers I've cast around the jewel, even Grigorius won't be able to sense it."

    --> Units:

            Deva's Fury has attack-only special now.
            This fixes her degraded functionality when she gains it
            It was apparent that this was the her goto retaliation attack and this made
            a walking defeat-condition during late game. So, making it offense-only.

            Removed Melee AMLA...I mean why...revan...just why?

V. 1.0.4

- General
        - Ported to Wesnoth 1.16.
        - Due to removal of the deprecated AI_CONTROLLER macro, it's not possible to issue instructions to allied sides anymore in certain scenarios (the instructions really didn't do much so this shouldn't affect gameplay).

- Scenarios
        - It's no longer possible to win the survival scenarios S4 Lightning Strike or S13 Twilight of the Kingdoms by defeating all enemy leaders. This is somewhat of a temporary fix to avoid missing out on the leader Dvalin or the ending dialogue.

- Units
	- Added back Ethereal Orbs which were removed from War of Legends, renamed the old version of the Wisp to Ethereal Wisp.
